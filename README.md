# Pitch

Untitled Camera Game is a 3D visual novel + photographer simulator where a photographer takes photos of models while talking to them to stir up emotions.

## Story

The photographer is known for his technique of exchanging stories with the model and capture expressions on their face. He also recycles stories of models to use it for future shooting sessions. One time his story matched up with ㊙’s story. Turns out ㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙. ㊙ would ㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙. The photographer then realized he has been ㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙, and even though ㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙ has finally for once ㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙㊙.

In the story, there could be conversations about the male gaze, philosophy art and what it means to be an artist.

## Gameplay

The player take photos in order to advance the conversation or choose the dialog to say to the model. The position of the camera and the model’s pose would change from time to time as modeling usually requires the model to freeze in place (we would probably only need to animate the breathing). The player would be able to rotate, zoom, and change focus on the camera in order to get different compositions. When it’s time to pick what to say to the model, key phrases would appear on the screen, the player would then need to focus on the phrase they want to express and click the shutter. This would result different composition of the photo for each choice.
